Hello there! My name is Wendryl Santos. 
I'm a fullstack web developer and this blog has as it's main goal to share my experience and thoughts about software development.

Here you'll find tutorials, technical articles and fun facts about what we usually see on an everyday life of a software developer.

#### My Experience
I'm primary experienced in Angular on the front-end side and .NET / Laravel on the back-end side.  
I currently work as Fullstack developer at [Lean Tech][lean-tech].

#### My Hobbies
When I'm not playing with side projects and different tech stuff I like to read books and play some music on the guitar. 
I also enjoy spending my free time with my wife and daughter.

You can find more about myself on my [Github][github-link], or [LinkedIn][linkedin-link].
